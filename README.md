# CS283: Heeger-Bergen Texture Synthesis Algorithm Tutorial

Final Project for CS283: Advanced Computer Vision

## Overview

Texture synthesis is a significant application of image pyramids, leveraging multi-resolution representations for analyzing images across various spatial scales. Steerable pyramids, a type of image pyramid, offer numerous advantages, providing a rich representation that includes information about image scale and orientation. In this tutorial, we explore the implementation of the Heeger-Bergen algorithm for synthesizing grayscale textures using steerable pyramids. The tutorial extends the algorithm to adapt to different image sizes, explores color textures, and addresses the handling of edges in textures.
