# CS283: Heeger-Bergen Texture Synthesis Algorithm Tutorial

Final Project for CS283: Advanced Computer Vision

## Abstract

Texture synthesis is a significant application of image pyramids, leveraging multi-resolution representations for analyzing images across various spatial scales. Steerable pyramids, a type of image pyramid, offer numerous advantages, providing a rich representation that includes information about image scale and orientation. In this tutorial, we explore the implementation of the Heeger-Bergen algorithm for synthesizing grayscale textures using steerable pyramids. The tutorial extends the algorithm to adapt to different image sizes, explores color textures, and addresses the handling of edges in textures.

## Overview

During class lectures, we delved into the properties of steerable pyramids and their role in texture synthesis. To deepen our practical understanding, this tutorial focuses on the Heeger-Bergen algorithm. The algorithm is used for synthesizing grayscale textures and is extended to handle various aspects such as different image sizes, color textures, and edge handling.
